# Binary-tree-1
Binary tree is a special case of a general tree where you can have maximum 2 children for any given node. They are useful in implementing set/map class in different programming languages. They provide efficient way of search an element in log n complexity


1. find_min(): finds minimum element in entire binary tree
2. find_max(): finds maximum element in entire binary tree
3. calculate_sum(): calcualtes sum of all elements
4. post_order_traversal(): performs post order traversal of a binary tree
5. pre_order_traversal(): perofrms pre order traversal of a binary tree
